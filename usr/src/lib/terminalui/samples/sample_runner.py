'''sample_runner: This is a "runner" for the other files in this sample
directory. To see samples in action, do the following:

* Build the gate (a proto area populated with terminalui files is required)
* Set your PYTHONPATH ($ROOT is the path to your proto area,
        e.g. "/export/ws/slim_source/proto/root_i386"):
    export PYTHONPATH=${ROOT}/usr/snadm/lib:\
        ${ROOT}/usr/lib/python2.7/vendor-packages/:${ROOT}/usr/lib/installadm
* cd into this directory
* Run one of the following commands:
    o To see the samples for hello_world, lists, edits, saving_state, and
        validation, run:
            $ python sample_runner.py
    o To see the samples for selectors.py, run:
            $ python sample_runner.py flow
