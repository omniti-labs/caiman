terminalui sample: Validating input and displaying errors

This sample shows how to validate user input at each of three levels:
* Per keystroke (EditFields only)
* Upon losing focus (EditFields only)
* Prior to leaving the screen

Additionally, various methods of displaying errors are demonstrated here.
